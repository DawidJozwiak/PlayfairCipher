Project implements Playfair Cipher in Java. The Playfair cipher is a digraph substitution cipher. It employs a table where one letter of the alphabet is omitted, 
and the letters are arranged in a 5x5 grid. The J is removed from the alphabet and an I takes its place in the text that is to be encoded. 

User inputs message to encrypt or decrypt and separator. Key is provided into command line.

Project uses junit tests/lamba expressions/functional interfaces/collections/streams/MVC pattern/exception handling/annotations and javadoc documentation.
